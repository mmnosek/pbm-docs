# Initial setup

After you [install Percona Backup for MongoDB](../installation.md) on every server with the `mongod` node that is not an arbiter node, the setup steps are the following:

1. [Configure authentication in MongoDB](#configure-authentication-in-mongodb).

2. [Configure the remote backup storage](#configure-remote-backup-storage).

3. [Start `pbm-agent` process](#start-the-pbm-agent-process).

The following diagram outlines the installation and setup steps:

## Configure authentication in MongoDB

Percona Backup for MongoDB uses the authentication and authorization subsystem  of MongoDB. This means that to authenticate Percona Backup for MongoDB, you need to:

* [Create a corresponding `pbm` user](#create-the-pbm-user) in the `admin` database 
* [Set a valid MongoDB connection URI string for **pbm-agent**](#set-the-mongodb-connection-uri-for-pbm-agent) 
* [Set a valid MongoDB connection URI string for `pbm` CLI](#set-the-mongodb-connection-uri-for-pbm-cli)

### Create the `pbm` user

!!! note ""

     This step needs to be executed on a primary node of each replica set. In a sharded cluster, this means on every shard replica set and the config server replica set.
    
1. Create the role that allows any action on any resource.

     ```javascript
     db.getSiblingDB("admin").createRole({ "role": "pbmAnyAction",
           "privileges": [
              { "resource": { "anyResource": true },
                "actions": [ "anyAction" ]
              }
           ],
           "roles": []
        });
     ```

2. Create the user and assign the role you created to it.

     ```javascript
     db.getSiblingDB("admin").createUser({user: "pbmuser",
            "pwd": "secretpwd",
            "roles" : [
               { "db" : "admin", "role" : "readWrite", "collection": "" },
               { "db" : "admin", "role" : "backup" },
               { "db" : "admin", "role" : "clusterMonitor" },
               { "db" : "admin", "role" : "restore" },
               { "db" : "admin", "role" : "pbmAnyAction" }
            ]
         });
     ```

You can specify the `username` and `password` values and other options of the `createUser` command as you require so long as the roles shown above are granted.


!!! tip

    To list all the host+port lists for the shard replica sets in a cluster, run the following command:

    ```javascript
    db.getSiblingDB(“config”).shards.find({}, {“host”: true, “_id”: false}) 
    ```

    The replica set name at the *front* of these “host” strings will have to be placed as a “/?replicaSet=xxxx” argument in the parameters part of the connection URI (see below).

### Set the MongoDB connection URI for `pbm-agent`

!!! note ""

     This step needs to be executed on each node where `pbm-agent` is installed.


A **pbm-agent** process connects to its localhost `mongod` node with a standalone type of connection. 

To set the MongoDB URI connection string means to configure a service init script (`pbm-agent.service` systemd unit file) that runs a **pbm-agent**.

The `pbm-agent.service` systemd unit file includes the environment file. You set the MongoDB URI connection string for the  `PBM_MONGODB_URI` variable within the environment file for every **pbm-agent**.

??? tip "How to find the environment file"

    The path to the environment file is specified in the `pbm-agent.service` systemd unit file.

    In Ubuntu and Debian, the pbm-agent.service systemd unit file is at the path `/lib/systemd/system/pbm-agent.service`.

    In Red Hat and CentOS, the path to this file is `/usr/lib/systemd/system/pbm-agent.service`.

    **Example of pbm-agent.service systemd unit file**

    ```init
    [Unit]
    Description=pbm-agent
    After=time-sync.target network.target

    [Service]
    EnvironmentFile=-/etc/default/pbm-agent
    Type=simple
    User=pbm
    Group=pbm
    PermissionsStartOnly=true
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/pbm-agent

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

=== "On Debian and Ubuntu Linux"

    Edit the environment file `/etc/default/pbm-agent` and specify the MongoDB connection URI string for the `pbm` user to the local `mongod` node.

    For example, if `mongod` node listens on port 27017, the MongoDB connection URI string will be the following:

    ```
    PBM_MONGODB_URI="mongodb://pbmuser:secretpwd@localhost:27017/?authSource=admin"
    ```

=== "On Red Hat Enterprise Linux and derivatives"

    Edit the environment file `/etc/sysconfig/pbm-agent` and specify the MongoDB connection URI string for the `pbm` user to the local `mongod` node. 

    For example, if `mongod` node listens on port 27017, the MongoDB connection URI string will be the following:

    ```
    PBM_MONGODB_URI="mongodb://pbmuser:secretpwd@localhost:27017/?authSource=admin"
    ```


#### Passwords with special characters

If the password includes special characters like `#`, `@`, `/` and so on, you must convert these characters using the [percent-encoding mechanism](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-2.1) when passing them to Percona Backup for MongoDB. For example, the password `secret#pwd` should be passed as follows in `PBM_MONGODB_URI`:

```
PBM_MONGODB_URI="mongodb://pbmuser:secret%23pwd@localhost:27017/?authSource=admin"
```

### Set the MongoDB connection URI for `pbm CLI`

!!! note ""

     This step needs to be executed only on a host that you will use `pbm` CLI at.

Set the MongoDB URI connection string for `pbm` CLI in your shell. This allows you to call `pbm` commands without the `--mongodb-uri` flag.

Use the following command:

```
export PBM_MONGODB_URI="mongodb://pbmuser:secretpwd@localhost:27017/?authSource=admin&replSetName=xxxx"
```

For more information about what connection string to specify, refer to the [pbm connection string](../details/authentication.md#mongodb-connection-strings-a-reminder-or-primer) section.

### External authentication support in Percona Backup for MongoDB

In addition to SCRAM, Percona Backup for MongoDB supports other [authentication methods](https://docs.percona.com/percona-server-for-mongodb/6.0/authentication.html) that you use in MongoDB or Percona Server for MongoDB.

For external authentication, you create the `pbm` user in the format used by the authentication system and set the MongoDB connection URI string to include both the authentication method and authentication source.

For example, for [Kerberos authentication](https://docs.percona.com/percona-server-for-mongodb/6.0/authentication.html#kerberos-authentication), create the `pbm` user in the `$external` database in the format `<username@KERBEROS_REALM>` (e.g. [pbm@PERCONATEST.COM](mailto:pbm@PERCONATEST.COM)).

Specify the following string for MongoDB connection URI:

```
PBM_MONGODB_URI="mongodb://<username>%40<KERBEROS_REALM>@<hostname>:27018/?authMechanism=GSSAPI&authSource=%24external&replSetName=xxxx"
```

Note that you must first obtain the ticket for the `pbm` user with the `kinit` command before you start the **pbm-agent**:

```{.bash data-prompt="$"}
$ sudo -u {USER} kinit pbm
```

Note that the `{USER}` is the user that you will run the `pbm-agent` process.

For [authentication and authorization via Native LDAP](https://docs.percona.com/percona-server-for-mongodb/6.0/authorization.html#authentication-and-authorization-with-direct-binding-to-ldap), you only create roles for LDAP groups in MongoDB as the users are stored and managed on the LDAP server. However, you still define the `$external` database as your authentication source:

```
PBM_MONGODB_URI="mongodb://<user>:<password>@<hostname>:27017/?authMechanism=PLAIN&authSource=%24external&replSetName=xxxx"
```

When using [AWS IAM authentication](), create the `pbm` user in the `$external` database with the username that contains the ARN of the IAM user/role.


=== "User authentication"

     ```
     arn:aws:iam::<ARN>:user/<user_name>
     ```

=== "Role authentication"

     ```
     arn:aws:iam::<ARN>:role/<role_name>
     ```

The MongoDB connection URI string then looks like the following:

```
PBM_MONGODB_URI="mongodb://<aws_access_key_id>:<aws_secret_access_key>@<hostname>:27017/?authMechanism=MONGODB-AWS&authSource=%24external&replSetName=xxxx"
```

## Configure remote backup storage

The easiest way to provide remote backup storage configuration is to specify it in a YAML config file and upload this file to Percona Backup for MongoDB using `pbm` CLI.

The storage configuration itself is out of scope of the present document. We assume that you have configured one of the supported remote backup storages.


1. Create a config file (e.g. `pbm_config.yaml`).

2. Specify the storage information within.

    The following is the sample configuration for Amazon AWS:

    ```yaml
    storage:
      type: s3
      s3:
        region: us-west-2
        bucket: pbm-test-bucket
        prefix: data/pbm/backup
        credentials:
          access-key-id: <your-access-key-id-here>
          secret-access-key: <your-secret-key-here>
        serverSideEncryption:
          sseAlgorithm: aws:kms
          kmsKeyID: <your-kms-key-here>
    ```

    This is the sample configuration for Microsoft Azure Blob storage:

    ```yaml
    storage:
      type: azure
      azure:
        account: <your-account>
        container: <your-container>
        prefix: pbm
        credentials:
          key: <your-access-key>
    ```

    This is the sample configuration for filesystem storage:

    ```yaml
    storage:
      type: filesystem
      filesystem:
        path: /data/local_backups
    ```

    See more examples in [Configuration file examples](../details/storage-config-example.md).


3. Insert the config file

```{.bash data-prompt="$"}
$ pbm config --file pbm_config.yaml
```

To learn more about Percona Backup for MongoDB configuration, see [Percona Backup for MongoDB configuration in a cluster (or non-sharded replica set)](../reference/config.md).

## Start the `pbm-agent` process

Start `pbm-agent` on every server with the `mongod` node installed. It is best to use the packaged service scripts to run `pbm-agent`.

```{.bash data-prompt="$"}
$ sudo systemctl start pbm-agent
$ sudo systemctl status pbm-agent
```

For example, imagine that you put configsvr nodes (listen port `27019`) collocated on the same servers as the first shard’s `mongod` nodes (listen port `27018`, replica set name `sh1rs`). In this server there should be two `pbm-agent` processes, one connected to the shard (e.g. `“mongodb://username:password@localhost:27018/”`) and one to the configsvr node (e.g. `“mongodb://username:password@localhost:27019/”`).

For reference, the following is an example of starting `pbm-agent` manually. The
output is redirected to a file and the process is backgrounded.

!!! important

    Start the `pbm-agent` as the `mongod` user. The `pbm-agent` requires write access to the MongoDB data directory to make physical restores.

```{.bash data-prompt="$"}
$ su mongod nohup pbm-agent --mongodb-uri "mongodb://username:password@localhost:27018/" > /data/mdb_node_xyz/pbm-agent.$(hostname -s).27018.log 2>&1 &
```

Replace `username` and `password` with those of your `pbm` user. `/data/mdb_node_xyz/` is the path where **pbm-agent** log files will be written. Make sure you have created this directory and granted write permissions to it for the `mongod` user.

Alternatively, you can run `pbm-agent` on a shell terminal temporarily if you want to observe and/or debug the startup from the log messages.

### How to see the `pbm-agent` log

With the packaged `systemd` service, the log output to `stdout` is captured by
systemd’s default redirection to `systemd-journald`. You can view it with the
command below. See `man journalctl` for useful options such as `--lines`, `--follow`, etc.

```{.bash data-prompt="$"}
$ journalctl -u pbm-agent.service
-- Logs begin at Tue 2019-10-22 09:31:34 JST. --
Jan 22 15:59:14 : Started pbm-agent.
Jan 22 15:59:14 pbm-agent[3579]: pbm agent is listening for the commands
...
...
```

If you started `pbm-agent` manually, see the file you redirected stdout and stderr to.

When a message `pbm agent is listening for the commands` is printed to the
`pbm-agent` log file, `pbm-agent` confirms that it has connected to its `mongod` node successfully.
